# AI Lunar Landing Game

## Overview

Welcome to the AI Lunar Landing Game project! This project showcases an artificial intelligence system that learns to land a spacecraft on the lunar surface in a simulated game environment. The AI utilizes neural networks and reinforcement learning techniques to master the challenging task of safe lunar landings.
